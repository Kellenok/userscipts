This script cleans up AniList, giving you more info in one place:

*   **Ratings Together:** Pulls scores from MyAnimeList, Kitsu, & Shikimori into the header for easy comparison.
*   **Choose Your Titles:** Pick romaji, English, or native for main/secondary title display.
*   **Genres & Tags Up Top:** Moves them to the header, so you see them clearly. Tags can expand to view all of them.
*   **Clean Interface:** Small layout tweaks make everything easier to read with less clutter.
